# Claude Code Configuration

This file provides context and instructions for Claude Code when working on this project.

## Project Overview

This is **TKDojang**, a Taekwondo learning iOS app built with SwiftUI using the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture pattern. The app is designed to help users learn Taekwondo from beginner to advanced levels with structured lessons, technique demonstrations, and progress tracking.

## Architecture & Patterns

- **MVVM-C Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator pattern for clean separation of concerns
- **Feature-based Organization**: Code is organized by features rather than file types
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Heavy use of protocols for dependency injection and testability
- **Reactive Programming**: Uses Combine framework for reactive data flow
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework

## Key Conventions

### Code Style
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every public interface must include detailed documentation explaining WHY decisions were made
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, self-documenting variable and function names
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file/class should have one clear purpose
- **No Magic Numbers**: Use constants from `AppConstants.swift`

### File Organization
- Features are organized in `/Sources/Features/[FeatureName]/`
- Shared code goes in `/Sources/Core/`
- Each feature should have its own coordinator for navigation
- Models and utilities are centralized in `/Sources/Core/Utils/`

### Testing
- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- UI tests for critical user workflows
- Test files mirror the source structure
- Use dependency injection to enable mocking

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. Create a new directory under `/Sources/Features/`
2. Implement a coordinator for navigation management
3. Follow the established pattern of separating views, view models, and models
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Update documentation

### When Modifying Architecture
1. Explain the reasoning behind architectural changes
2. Update this CLAUDE.md file with new patterns
3. Ensure changes are consistent across the entire codebase
4. Consider impact on testing and maintainability

### Documentation Standards
- Include `PURPOSE:` sections explaining why code exists
- Document architectural decisions and their benefits
- Provide usage examples for complex APIs
- Explain trade-offs and alternative approaches considered

## Current State

The project currently has:
- ✅ Working Xcode project with proper build configuration
- ✅ Basic app structure and navigation coordinator (MVVM-C pattern)
- ✅ Authentication UI with sign-in/registration forms
- ✅ Onboarding flow for first-time users
- ✅ Loading screen with app branding
- ✅ Main tab navigation structure (placeholder content)
- ✅ Coordinator pattern for navigation management
- ⏳ TODO: Authentication service integration (currently simulated)
- ⏳ TODO: User preferences and data persistence
- ⏳ TODO: Technique library and training sessions
- ⏳ TODO: Progress tracking and analytics

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Authentication Service Integration**: Replace simulated authentication with real service
2. **User Data Persistence**: Implement proper data storage and user preferences
3. **Technique Library**: Build technique viewing and learning features
4. **Training Sessions**: Implement structured workout experiences
5. **Progress Tracking**: Add analytics and achievement systems

## Testing Commands

The project now has a working Xcode configuration:

```bash
# Build the project
# Use Xcode: Cmd+B or Product → Build

# Run unit tests
# Use Xcode: Cmd+U or Product → Test

# Run on simulator
# Use Xcode: Cmd+R or Product → Run

# Build for device
# Select device target and use Cmd+R
```

## Environment Configuration

The app supports multiple environments through build configurations:
- `DEBUG`: Development environment with debug features enabled
- `STAGING`: Staging environment for testing
- `RELEASE`: Production environment

Environment-specific constants are managed in `AppConstants.swift` using compiler directives.

## Notes for Claude Code

- This project emphasizes **education and explanation** - always explain WHY architectural decisions are made
- **Comprehensive documentation** is critical - users are learning iOS development
- **Best practices** should be highlighted and explained throughout the codebase
- When suggesting changes, explain the benefits and trade-offs
- Consider the long-term maintainability and scalability of all code changes
