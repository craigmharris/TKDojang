## Design Patterns

### 1. Coordinator Pattern

**Purpose**: Separates navigation logic from view controllers

```swift
// Example: AppCoordinator manages app-wide navigation
class AppCoordinator: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentFlow: AppFlow = .loading
    
    func showMainFlow() {
        withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3)) {
            currentFlow = .main
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Navigation logic is testable
- Views remain focused on display logic
- Easy to modify navigation flows
- Supports deep linking and programmatic navigation

### 2. Repository Pattern

**Purpose**: Abstracts data access and provides a consistent interface

```swift
// Example: TerminologyDataService protocol
protocol TerminologyDataServiceProtocol {
    func loadTerminology(for beltLevel: BeltLevel) async throws -> [TerminologyEntry]
    func getAllTerminology() async throws -> [TerminologyEntry]
    func getTerminologyCategories() async throws -> [TerminologyCategory]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables easy testing with mock implementations
- Separates business logic from data access details
- Supports multiple data sources (JSON files, SwiftData, cache)
- Makes it easy to change data storage mechanisms

### 3. Reactive Programming with Combine

**Purpose**: Creates responsive UI that automatically updates when data changes

```swift
// Example: Reactive profile state management
profileService.currentProfile
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] profile in
        self?.updateUIForProfile(profile)
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual state synchronization
- Reduces bugs from outdated UI state
- Enables complex data flow with simple composition
- Provides built-in error handling and threading
