## Architecture Overview

This app follows a **clean, scalable architecture** designed for long-term maintainability and team collaboration:

### Core Architectural Decisions

1. **MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)**: Separates concerns and makes navigation testable
2. **Feature-based organization**: Groups related functionality together instead of separating by file type
3. **Protocol-oriented programming**: Enables dependency injection and easy testing
4. **Reactive programming with Combine**: Provides responsive UI and data flow
5. **SwiftUI + UIKit hybrid**: Modern SwiftUI for UI with UIKit when needed

### Why These Choices?

- **Scalability**: Structure supports adding new features without creating chaos
- **Testability**: Dependency injection and separation of concerns enable comprehensive testing
- **Team collaboration**: Clear boundaries make it easier for multiple developers to work together
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented, single-responsibility components are easier to modify
- **Performance**: Reactive patterns minimize unnecessary UI updates

### Key Directory Explanations

#### `/Sources/App/`
Contains the application's entry point and root-level views. These files manage the overall app lifecycle and coordinate between major application flows.

#### `/Sources/Features/`
Each subdirectory represents a major feature area of the app:
- **Learning**: Enhanced flashcard system with profile support and session tracking
- **Profile**: Complete multi-profile management with ProfileService architecture
- **Testing**: Profile-aware multiple choice testing with advanced analytics
- **Patterns**: Traditional pattern learning system with 9 complete patterns
- **Dashboard**: Main navigation with profile integration and switching

This organization:
- **Reduces merge conflicts** - developers can work on different features independently
- **Improves code discoverability** - all related files are grouped together
- **Enables feature flags** - entire features can be easily enabled/disabled
- **Supports modularization** - features can potentially become separate modules

#### `/Sources/Core/`
Shared code that multiple features depend on:
- **Data**: SwiftData models, content management, and comprehensive service layer
- **Content**: 13 belt-level terminology files and 9 traditional pattern definitions
- **Models**: All SwiftData models including advanced Profile and Pattern models
- **Services**: Data access services (TerminologyService, PatternService, ProfileService)
- **Coordinators**: Navigation coordinators that manage app flow between features
- **Utils**: Shared utilities, theming, belt progression system, and design components

#### `/TKDojangTests/`
Comprehensive testing infrastructure:
- **BasicFunctionalityTests**: Core framework validation and model creation
- **MultiProfileSystemTests**: Profile system validation with data isolation testing
- **FlashcardSystemTests_Simple**: Spaced repetition algorithm and mastery progression
- **PerformanceTests**: Database performance, memory usage, and bulk operations
- **TestHelpers**: Complete test infrastructure with factories, assertions, and utilities

#### `/Scripts/`
Development and content management tools:
- **csv-to-terminology.swift**: Enhanced tool for bulk content creation from CSV files

## Design Patterns

### 1. Coordinator Pattern

**Purpose**: Separates navigation logic from view controllers

```swift
// Example: AppCoordinator manages app-wide navigation
class AppCoordinator: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentFlow: AppFlow = .loading
    
    func showMainFlow() {
        withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3)) {
            currentFlow = .main
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Navigation logic is testable
- Views remain focused on display logic
- Easy to modify navigation flows
- Supports deep linking and programmatic navigation

### 2. Repository Pattern

**Purpose**: Abstracts data access and provides a consistent interface

```swift
// Example: TerminologyDataService protocol
protocol TerminologyDataServiceProtocol {
    func loadTerminology(for beltLevel: BeltLevel) async throws -> [TerminologyEntry]
    func getAllTerminology() async throws -> [TerminologyEntry]
    func getTerminologyCategories() async throws -> [TerminologyCategory]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables easy testing with mock implementations
- Separates business logic from data access details
- Supports multiple data sources (JSON files, SwiftData, cache)
- Makes it easy to change data storage mechanisms

### 3. Reactive Programming with Combine

**Purpose**: Creates responsive UI that automatically updates when data changes

```swift
// Example: Reactive profile state management
profileService.currentProfile
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [weak self] profile in
        self?.updateUIForProfile(profile)
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual state synchronization
- Reduces bugs from outdated UI state
- Enables complex data flow with simple composition
- Provides built-in error handling and threading

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 deployment target (required for SwiftData)
- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS for development

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd TKDojang
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open TKDojang.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run**:
   - Select your target device or simulator
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run

### Configuration

The app is designed to work out-of-the-box with no external dependencies:

- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally using SwiftData (no cloud setup required)
- **Content Loading**: Terminology and pattern data loaded from bundled JSON files
- **Profile Management**: Up to 6 device-local profiles with independent progress tracking
- **No Network Required**: App functions completely offline

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Documentation**: Every public interface must include comprehensive documentation
   - Explain **WHY** decisions were made, not just what the code does
   - Include usage examples for complex APIs
   - Document architectural patterns and their benefits

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive, self-documenting names
   - Prefer clarity over brevity
   - Follow Swift API Design Guidelines

3. **File Organization**:
   - Group related functionality together
   - Use feature-based organization
   - Keep files focused on single responsibilities

### Testing Strategy

Our comprehensive testing approach ensures reliability and prevents regressions:

#### **1. Unit Tests (40 tests)**

## Known Issues & Lessons Learned

### ✅ **Successfully Resolved SwiftData Performance Issues**

During development, we encountered and successfully resolved significant SwiftData performance issues. The **ProfileService pattern** in the feature/patterns-tul branch provides the proven solution:

#### **1. SwiftData Relationship Navigation ✅ SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: Accessing `userProfile.terminologyProgress` directly caused app hangs
- **Root Cause**: SwiftData relationship loading blocked the main thread
- **Solution Applied**: ProfileService with async methods prevents direct relationship access
- **Result**: Smooth UI performance with automatic session tracking

#### **2. Complex Nested Predicates ✅ SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: Complex predicates across relationships caused compilation failures
- **Root Cause**: SwiftData predicate compiler limitations with nested relationships
- **Solution Applied**: Simple queries with programmatic filtering in service layer
- **Result**: Reliable queries with better performance and maintainability

#### **3. Service Initialization ✅ SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: ProfileService initialization during DataManager creation caused deadlock
- **Root Cause**: Circular dependency during container setup
- **Solution Applied**: Proper dependency injection with lazy initialization
- **Result**: Clean initialization order with no circular dependencies

#### **4. Direct Model Access in Views ✅ SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: Views accessing SwiftData relationships blocked the main thread
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous database queries during SwiftUI view updates
- **Solution Applied**: Service layer with async methods and proper @MainActor threading
- **Result**: Responsive UI with background data loading

### **Architecture Success Story**
The **feature/patterns-tul branch demonstrates the successful resolution** of all previous performance issues through the ProfileService pattern. This branch should serve as the foundation for all future development.
