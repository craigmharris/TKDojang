    <h1>TKDojang Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: 21 November 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>TKDojang is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your learning data belongs to you, and we've built the app to minimise data collection whilst providing a comprehensive Taekwondo learning experience.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics Tracking:</strong> We do not use analytics services to track your usage patterns, screen views, or behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> We do not share data with advertisers, data brokers, or third-party services.</li>
        <li><strong>No Location Data:</strong> We do not access or collect your location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All your learning data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User profiles (names, belt levels, learning preferences)</li>
        <li>Study session history and progress tracking</li>
        <li>Flashcard performance and spaced repetition data</li>
        <li>Pattern practice completion and mastery levels</li>
        <li>Test scores and results</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This data never leaves your device</strong> unless you explicitly use iCloud Backup (see below).</p>

    <h2>Optional iCloud Backup</h2>
    <p>If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your locally stored TKDojang data may be included in your device's encrypted iCloud backup. This is controlled by your device settings, not by the app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iCloud backups are encrypted and only accessible to you</li>
        <li>We (the developers) cannot access your iCloud backup data</li>
        <li>You can disable iCloud Backup in iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CloudKit Community Features (Optional)</h2>
    <p>TKDojang includes optional community features (feedback submission, feature roadmap voting) that use Apple's CloudKit service. These features are entirely optional—you can use the app fully offline without ever accessing them.</p>

    <h3>What CloudKit Collects (Only When You Use Community Features):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> Apple assigns a random identifier (not your Apple ID or email) when you use CloudKit features</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Content:</strong> Text you submit via the feedback form</li>
        <li><strong>Roadmap Votes:</strong> Which features you vote for (anonymous, not tied to personal identity)</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Usage Data:</strong> You can choose to share your belt level, learning mode, and study statistics with feedback submissions to help prioritise features. This is opt-in with a toggle in the feedback form.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> App version, iOS version, device model (for debugging purposes only)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What CloudKit Does NOT Collect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Apple ID or email address</li>
        <li>Your personal information (names, contact details)</li>
        <li>Your complete study history or progress data</li>
        <li>Any data from other apps on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CloudKit Data Retention:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Feedback and votes are stored in Apple's CloudKit Public Database</li>
        <li>This data is world-readable (other users can see submitted feedback and vote counts for transparency)</li>
        <li>You can only edit or delete your own submissions</li>
        <li>Developer responses to feedback are visible to the submitter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Push Notifications (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you grant notification permission, you'll receive alerts when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A developer responds to your feedback</li>
        <li>New features you voted for are released</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notifications are sent via Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). We do not use notifications for marketing or advertisements. You can disable notifications at any time in iOS Settings → Notifications → TKDojang.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>TKDojang is designed for families, including children learning Taekwondo. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data is stored locally on the device, and CloudKit features are optional and anonymous.</p>
    <p>Parents can create separate profiles for children and monitor their usage directly on the device. No data leaves the device unless parents explicitly enable iCloud Backup or children use CloudKit community features.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All device-stored data uses Apple's SwiftData framework with built-in encryption</li>
        <li><strong>CloudKit:</strong> All CloudKit data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS)</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Access:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your local data is accessible within the app's profile settings</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual profiles or all app data via iOS Settings → General → iPhone Storage → TKDojang → Delete App</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> The app includes profile export functionality (JSON format) for backup purposes</li>
        <li><strong>CloudKit Data:</strong> You can request deletion of CloudKit submissions by contacting us (see below)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>GDPR Compliance (European Users)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> We process data based on your consent (opt-in for CloudKit features) and legitimate interest (local storage for app functionality)</li>
        <li><strong>Data Controller:</strong> Craig Matthew Harris (developer)</li>
        <li><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object to processing of your personal data</li>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> To exercise your rights, email feedback@tkdojang.app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Significant changes will be announced via the app's "What's New" section. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
