       Significance:Named after the famous Gwang-Gae-To-Wang, the 19th king of the Koguryo Dynasty, who regained all the lost
       territories including the greater part of Manchuria. The diagram represents the expansion and recovery of lost territory. The 39

        At age 72, when he refused to serve a new master and remained loyal to his king, he was said to be the 'Righteous Prime
       Minister'. The 36 movements represent his loyalty to his king by not serving the new dynasty which served his country for 500
       years.

       2. FEATURE TOURS

       File: /Users/craig/TKDojang/TKDojang/Sources/Core/Components/Tours/FeatureTourDefinitions.swift

       Flashcard Tour (5 steps)

       Step 1: Flashcard Learning
       Master Korean Taekwondo terminology through spaced repetition. Flashcards adapt to your learning progress, showing terms you 
       struggle with more frequently.

       Tip: Start with 10-15 cards to build confidence before larger sessions

       Step 2: Study Modes
       Choose 'Learn' mode to see answers immediately and build familiarity. Switch to 'Test' mode when ready to challenge your memory 
       without hints.

       Tip: Use Learn mode first, then Test mode once you know most terms

       Step 3: Card Direction
       Practice Korean→English to test recognition, English→Korean for recall, or Both to master terminology completely. Each direction 
       builds different skills.

       Tip: Start with Korean→English (easier), progress to English→Korean, and test yourself with both directions

       Step 4: Spaced Repetition
       The Leitner system automatically adjusts which cards you see based on your performance. Terms you know well appear less often, 
       while challenging terms return sooner.

       Tip: Trust the system - it optimises your learning efficiency

       Step 5: Ready to Start
       Configure your session with the number of cards, study mode, and direction. Your progress is saved automatically, and you can 
       resume anytime.

       Tip: Consistent short sessions (10-15 min) are more effective than long cramming

       ---
       Multiple Choice Tour (5 steps)

       Step 1: Multiple Choice Testing
       Test your Taekwondo knowledge with customisable quizzes. Choose from Quick tests (5-10 questions), Custom tests (configurable), 
       or Comprehensive tests (all available questions).

       Tip: Start with quick tests to gauge your knowledge level

       Step 2: Test Types
       Quick tests provide fast 5-10 question reviews. Custom tests let you choose exactly how many questions (10-25) to practice with. 
       Comprehensive tests include all available content for thorough preparation.

       Tip: Use quick tests for daily practice, comprehensive for exam prep

       Step 3: Question Count (Custom Only)
       When using Custom test mode, select between 10-25 questions in steps of 5. The slider shows how many questions are available for 
       your current configuration.

       Tip: Start with 10-15 questions until you build confidence

       Step 4: Belt Scope Selection
       Choose 'Current Belt Only' to test just your current level, or 'All Belts Up to Current' to include all belts from white belt 
       through your current rank for comprehensive review.

       Tip: Focus on current belt first, then expand to all belts for review

       Step 5: Ready to Test
       Configure your test settings and tap Start Test. There's no time limit - focus on learning, not speed. After each test, review 
       detailed results showing what you missed and why.

       Tip: Review wrong answers immediately while the content is fresh

       ---
       Pattern Practice Tour (3 steps)

       Step 1: Pattern Practice
       Practice traditional ITF Taekwondo patterns with step-by-step guidance. Each pattern is appropriate for your belt level and 
       builds on previous patterns.

       Tip: Master each pattern's diagram before practicing individual moves

       Step 2: Move-by-Move Guidance
       Navigate through each move with detailed descriptions, Korean terminology, and key points. Swipe or tap arrows to progress 
       through the pattern at your own pace.

       Tip: Practice slowly first, focusing on correct form over speed

       Step 3: Ready to Practice
       Select a pattern appropriate for your belt level. Practice each move carefully, and return anytime to review. Your progress 
       through patterns is tracked automatically.

       Tip: Practice patterns daily for 10-15 minutes to build muscle memory

       ---
       Step Sparring Tour (3 steps)

       Step 1: Step Sparring Sequences
       Learn pre-arranged sparring sequences that teach timing, distance, and defensive techniques. Each sequence follows a structured 
       attack, defence, and counter pattern.

       Tip: Practice with a partner to develop proper timing and control

       Step 2: Attack-Defence-Counter
       Each sequence shows the attacker's move, defender's block or evasion, and defender's counter-attack. Study each component 
       separately, then practice the full sequence.

       Tip: Understand the purpose of each move - defence isn't just blocking

       Step 3: Ready to Practice
       Select a sequence appropriate for your belt level. Review each step carefully before practicing with a partner. Sequences build 
       progressive difficulty as you advance.

       Tip: Focus on control and accuracy - speed develops naturally with practice

       ---
       Pattern Test Tour (4 steps)

       Step 1: Pattern Sequence Testing
       Test your memory of pattern move sequences by selecting the correct stance, technique, and movement for each move. This builds 
       muscle memory and ensures you know patterns thoroughly.

       Tip: Practice the pattern first before testing for better results

       Step 2: Three-Part Selection
       Each move requires three selections: Stance (your body position), Technique (the action you perform), and Movement (the direction
        you move). All three must be correct to fully master the pattern.

       Tip: Take your time - accuracy is more important than speed

       Step 3: Sequence Context
       View previous moves you've completed and upcoming moves for context. This helps you understand where you are in the pattern and 
       recall the sequence flow.

       Tip: Use context to visualize the full pattern flow as you test

       Step 4: Review Results
       After completing the test, review your accuracy for each component. Results show which moves you mastered and which need more 
       practice.

       Tip: Focus practice on moves where you made mistakes

       ---
       Vocabulary Builder Tour (5 steps)

       Step 1: Master Phrase Grammar
       Vocabulary Builder teaches Korean phrase grammar through 6 interactive games. Instead of memorising phrases, you'll learn word 
       categories, construction patterns, and creative building—skills that help you understand any technique name.

       Tip: Grammar skills transfer to all techniques, not just the ones you memorise

       Step 2: Six Complementary Game Modes
       Each game teaches phrase grammar from a different angle: Word Matching builds vocabulary, Slot Builder teaches structure, 
       Template Filler shows patterns, Phrase Decoder practices word order, Memory Match strengthens recall, and Creative Sandbox 
       encourages exploration.

       Tip: Try different games to find what works best for your learning style

       Step 3: Progressive Difficulty
       Start with Beginner games (Word Matching, Slot Builder) to build foundations. Progress to Intermediate games (Template Filler, 
       Phrase Decoder, Memory Match) for deeper practice. Advanced learners can experiment freely in Creative Sandbox.

       Tip: Master beginner games before moving to intermediate—build confidence first

       Step 4: How to Use
       Select a game mode from the dashboard. Each game has configuration options (difficulty, phrase length, card count) tailored to 
       that mode. Complete sessions at your own pace—progress is tracked automatically.

       Tip: Short, frequent sessions are more effective than long cramming

       Step 5: Ready to Build Vocabulary
       Choose your starting game based on experience level. Beginners: start with Word Matching to learn vocabulary. Intermediate: try 
       Slot Builder for phrase structure. Advanced: explore Creative Sandbox for free construction.

       Tip: The best game is the one you'll actually use—pick what looks fun!

       About TKDojang

       File: /Users/craig/TKDojang/TKDojang/Sources/Features/Profile/AboutView.swift

       Tagline:
       Traditional Taekwondo Learning Companion

       Why TKDojang Exists

       TKDojang began as a family project. While helping my children prepare for Taekwondo gradings, my partner and I created paper 
       flashcards to practice Korean terminology. As they progressed through belt levels, the content grew beyond what paper could 
       handle effectively.

       I searched for apps that could teach terminology in the same engaging way, but found nothing that combined high build quality 
       with visual appeal and effective learning methods. Coming from a coding background, I thought: 'I could build this with some time
        and study.'

       The real inspiration came from wanting to test generative AI as a learning tool for programming in SwiftUI – turning a martial 
       arts challenge into a technical adventure that benefits families worldwide.

       About the Developer

       I'm a dedicated parent with nearly twenty years of Taekwondo experience. After training for seven years and reaching 1st Keup, 
       life took me away from the martial arts for a decade. Now I've returned with my partner and five children, re-learning my way 
       back to my former level with hopes of achieving Dan grade soon.

       I train at a TAGB school in South West England, where I particularly enjoy patterns – the mental focus and precision they 
       require. While I may never be the strongest sparring partner, I'm committed to performing high-quality patterns with slow, 
       deliberate technique.

       My professional coding background gave me confidence to build this app, but my experience with language learning apps helped me 
       think differently about creating effective learning tools. I don't consider myself a teacher – rather, I'm curating content to 
       help others learn by sharing what has helped my family.

       Who TKDojang Is For

       Primary Users:
       Students and families looking to practice terminology and theory, with additional support for pattern and step sparring 
       retention. Recommended for ages 9 and up, with no upper age limit – it's never too late to learn Taekwondo!

       Learning Styles:
       While traditional front-of-class instruction works for many, students who struggle with spatial awareness or visualisation can 
       benefit from this alternative medium. Having multiple ways to practice helps accommodate different learning preferences.

       Usage Approach:
       Use TKDojang 'little and often' – a few times per week when approaching gradings, but less frequently overall. Ramp up before 
       belt tests, then ease off. This shouldn't be an app where you spend excessive time.

       Important:
       TKDojang is designed as a supplement to training in your dojang, never a replacement. No prior Taekwondo knowledge is required, but a few lessons help determine if the martial art is right for you.

       Content Sources & Accuracy

       Primary Sources:
       Content is built from a variety of curriculum materials and validated against the ITF pattern manual. Korean terminology draws from my instructors' teaching, cross-referenced with available online materials from multiple other schools across the UK and US.

       Quality Approach:
       Romanisation has been standardised, primarily for consistency. While transliterating a language will unavoidably lead to some disagreement about spelling or the 'correct' pronunciation, this isn't intended to be a Korean language learning app. Hangul is included for fun, built with generative AI, although I hope to soon have it cross referenced by multiple family members speaking fluent Korean.

       Acknowledgment:
       There will likely be mistakes, which I'll resolve as they're identified. A Korean-speaking family member and native speaker will 
       help maintain language accuracy over time. In the inimitable style of Douglas Adams, I'd love to say that the Guide is Definitive; Reality is frequently inaccurate. However, in the event of disagreement between this app and your instructor, your instructor is right every day and twice on training days.

       Future Plans:
       While starting with the TAGB standard syllabus (since it's what I'm learning), I hope to eventually accommodate multiple syllabuses, belt systems, and organisations as terminology doesn't vary dramatically between most Taekwondo schools - just the belt colours and the exact requirements of each belt.

       Feedback Welcome:
       I'm open to all content accuracy feedback and working toward a scalable way to manage corrections from the community. In the meantime, you'll find a community hub in the profile menu where you can submit feedback, feature suggestions, and vote on the upcoming roadmap. I'll endeavour to do the most asked for thing first, but with kids, a job, and my own training, it won't always be swift. While no-one will be able to see your name/details (including me, it's all held by Apple alone), I'd request that nothing identifiable is left in the roadmap suggestions since others will see them. I'll remove anything that I feel identifies another person or is anyway rude or offensive, and reserve the right to remove the feature if Godwin's law gets anywhere near a 0.2. Please also rate/review on the AppStore - the more people find it, the more the people can help build the app you want.

       Your Privacy Matters

       Local-Only Data:
       All profile and progress information stays on your device. I don't see any of your personal data – you don't even need to add 
       your name if you prefer not to.

       No Tracking:
       During TestFlight testing, I receive crash reports but no personal data. Nothing is tracked for advertising or other purposes. 
       This app is for users, not for data collection. If you submit a feedback comment or a suggestion, I'll know which OS version you're using and if you share it, the belet level and most used feature - that'll help calibrate the content expansion, but can never identify you, even if you're the only green belt running iOS 17.2 who likes the flashcards.

       Multiple Users:
       The app supports up to 6 local profiles per device, perfect for families while maintaining individual progress tracking. I'm looking at options for one purchase being enabled for family sharing so all the family can use on their own devices, but wanted the option for kids without their own device to use it too. 

       Trade-offs:
       The privacy-first approach means convenience features like instructor and club level accounts aren't available yet. Cloud features beyond your own iCloud data backup may come when I can guarantee the same level of privacy protection.

       Philosophy:
       This approach aligns with my preference to reduce screen time addiction across all technology touchpoints. TKDojang respects your
        time and attention. You can see your streak in the progress section and profile screen, but there's no reward other than learning. Put the app down every now and again, and put the whole phone down with it. No amount of app learning is a replacement for practising again and again, and if you can combine that with some time with a friend or family and no screens - all to the better.

       Where We're Heading

       Content Expansion:
       Additional belt levels, learning modes, and video content showing patterns and technique breakdowns from multiple angles. 
       Development will be driven by user feedback and needs.I'm keen that all 24 patterns make it in soon, along with semi-free sparring content and theory for those deep divers who want everything they can get.

       Geographic Goals:
       Eventually reaching a few thousand users UK-wide, serving a meaningful proportion of the student base across different schools 
       and organisations. I'd love for non-UK users to benefit too, but it'll be English speaking only due to the cost of translating the vast amount of content since I'm not a speaker of many languages. If there's demand though, and the revenue to pay for it, I'll do it.

       Collaboration:
       While I'll likely keep development as a solo effort, I'm eager to bring in collaborators for content creation and review to 
       ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness. Use a feedback submission if you'd like to get involved in writing some content, but I can't promise any payment - revenue is pitched just to offset some of the development costs.

       Success Metric:
       TKDojang will have achieved its purpose when users can progress from white belt to black belt using the app as a learning 
       companion throughout their entire journey.

       Ethical Technology:
       No engagement hooks, streaks, or rewards. No advertisements ever. Content should be engaging to improve learning effectiveness, 
       not to increase time spent in the app. The goal is learning, not screen time.

       Important Disclaimers:
       - TKDojang is a learning aid, not direct instruction
       - All physical activities are at your own risk
       - This app supplements but never replaces proper dojang-based training
       - Content accuracy is best-effort with ongoing improvements
       - No commercial use of app content permitted

       Pricing Philosophy:
       Small one-time fees cover development and maintenance costs only. No advertisements, subscriptions, or mandatory in-app 
       purchases. If sustainable support isn't possible, the app will be retired rather than compromised with invasive monetisation. The expected final price is £5.99, but the price will be reduced on launch while content continues building, with the revenue all diverted to development expense, such as photography and video content production.

       Contact & Feedback:
       Please use the built in community feature for feedback and contact; that allows me to respond without you ever needing to share your details, and where appropriate makes development choices and the roadmap something that everyone can play a part in driving.
